# Writing Principles

* **Be concise:** Use short words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary modifiers.
* **Be specific:** Avoid vague language. Cut the fluff.
* **Be consistent:** Stick to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.

&nbsp;
### **Write positively**
Use positive language rather than negative language. One way to detect negative language is to look for words like “can’t,” “don’t,” etc.

* **Yes:** Sign in to post an opportunity

* **No:** ~You can’t post an opportunity because you are not signed in~

&nbsp;
### **Gender**
Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”

* **Yes:** Connect with other businesspeople in the ecosystem.

* **No:** ~Connect with other businessmen in the ecosystem~

&nbsp;
### **Avoid blaming**
Don’t make the user feel responsible for errors taking place in our platform.

* **Yes:** This email address doesn’t match any user.

* **No:** ~You entered a wrong email address~

&nbsp;
### **Please**
Use *please* only when asking the user to do something inconvenient, or when the system is to blame for a big error.

* **Yes:** This process may take a while. Please wait until it is completed.

* **No:** ~Please enter your email address to log in~

&nbsp;
### **Sorry**
Use sorry only in error messages that result in serious problems for the user (for example, data loss, a screen freeze, or the need to contact Support).

* **Yes:** Sorry, you must exit and log in again.

* **No:** ~Sorry, but you must enter at least 6 characters~

# Grammar and Mechanisms

### **American English**
We use American English, which is reflected in our spelling.

|               | Yes           |  No   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| __*-ed*__           | burned        | ~burnt~ |
| __*-ense*__      | defense      |   ~defence~ |
| __*-el-*__ | canceled      |    ~cancelled~ |
| __*-ize*__      | organize      |   ~organise~ |
| __*-ization*__      | organization      |   ~organisation~ |
| __*-og*__ | catalog      |    ~catalogue~ |
| __*-am*__ | program      |    ~programme~ |
| __*-or*__      | color      |   ~colour~ |
| __*-er*__ | center      |    ~centre~ |

&nbsp;
### **Simple Tenses**
Use present simple, past simple and, in general, avoid complicated tenses.

* **Yes:** Question deleted

* **No:** ~Question has been deleted~

&nbsp;
### **Use Numerals**
Use numerals for notification-type communications (1, 2, 3 over one, two, three.) 

* **Yes:** You have 3 new messages

* **No:** ~You have three new messages~

&nbsp;
### **Capitalization**
Certain elements need to be capitalized when used. 

* **Names of departments and teams (but not the word "team" or "department")**
  * Marketing team
  * Support department

* **Individual job titles: when mentioning a specific role. Don't capitalize when referring to the role in general terms**
  * Philip Robson is the Marketing Manager
  * This is a great opportunity for marketing managers around the world

* **Institutions**
  * Singularity University
  * United Nations

* **File extensions: when referring to them generally, but in lowercase when referring to a specific file**
  * Upload a PDF file
  * The file ecosystemmembers.pdf does not exist

&nbsp;
### **Dates**
Use the American convention: DAY OF THE WEEK/ MONTH/ DAY NUMBER/ YEAR. Use the ordinal only when it is written in a sentence format.

| Yes           | No            |          
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| February 24, 2019 | ~24 February, 2019~|
| The 24th of February | ~February 24th, 2019~|

&nbsp;
### **Time**
We use am and pm in lowercase with a space between them and the number. We always include the minutes separated by a colon, even if it’s zero.

* **Yes:** The meeting will start at 8:00 am.

* **No:** ~The meeting will start at 8am~

When we are talking about a time period, we leave no spaces and separate the times with a hyphen.

* **Yes:** 8:00am-9:30am

* **No:** ~8:00 am - 9:30 am~

&nbsp;
### **Exclamation points**
Use exclamation points to be encouraging or generate excitement. Don’t use exclamation points in error messages, confirmation messages, or instructional text.

* **Yes:** Almost there! (To show progress during a process.)

* **No:** ~Your changes were saved!~
&nbsp;
### **Quotation marks**
We use double quotation marks and always put periods and commas inside them.

* **Yes:** “We are living in the 4th Industrial Revolution,” Salim Ismail said.

* **No:** ~“We are living in the 4th Industrial Revolution”, Salim Ismail said.~

&nbsp;
### **Contractions**
Do not use contractions unless it has been specifically decided to use them.

**YES:** If the link does not work, visit our page

**NO:** ~If the link doesn’t work, visit our page~

&nbsp;
### **Active and passive voice**
We use the active voice as a general rule since it allows for a direct and short style. However, the passive voice can be used if it helps to convey the message in a positive manner / if it improves the understanding.

* **Yes:** Emma McDonald wrote a blog entry

* **No:** ~A blog entry was written by Emma McDonald~

&nbsp;
### **Contractions**
Do not use contractions unless it has been specifically decided to use them.

* **Yes:** If the link does not work, visit our page

* **No:** ~If the link doesn’t work, visit our page~

&nbsp;
### **Adverbs**
When writing for the platform, avoid strong adverbs. The UX should speak by itself.

* **Yes:** Visit the link

* **No:** ~Visit the small link~
