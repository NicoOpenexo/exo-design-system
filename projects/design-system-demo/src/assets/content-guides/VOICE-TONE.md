# Voice & Tone

## Values

Our voice and tone are driven by our 5 main values representing who and how we want to be. Each one contains other subvalues that help us stay on point for every situation.

**1. INSPIRATIONAL:** transformative, purposeful, passionate.

**2. GLOBAL:** human, collaborative, connecting.

**3. INNOVATIVE:** emerging, visionary, creative.

**4. ACCESSIBLE:** social, empowering, empathetic.

**5. BOLD:** authentic, unconventional, inquiring/


## Voice
Our voice is constant. It communicates our personality and values through these three core principles:

**1. We love what we do →** We are passionate about what we do. We transmit that without being insisting or annoying; we are not politicians trying to convince the masses, we are a human team who believes in what can be achieved through transformation. We love to explore new horizons and we want as many people as possible to come onboard. (INSPIRATIONAL, ACCESSIBLE, GLOBAL, BOLD)

&nbsp;

**2. We are regular people with a vision→** We are just regular people who believe in innovation and the power of transformation. We know our field but are not cocky when speaking to customers. Our customers’ success is our success, that is why we are empathetic about their needs and empowering at the same time. (ACCESSIBLE, INSPIRATIONAL, BOLD, INNOVATIVE)

&nbsp;

**3. We are plainspoken →** We know the domains we work on are moving fast and new trends come up every day, but we don’t want to use a language full of technical terms that nobody understands. We explain concepts and terms as needed when they arise. Our language is not too formal but not rude: we want to be equally understood by your grandma and someone with a PhD in Robotics. (ACCESSIBLE, GLOBAL)

## Tone
Our tone can change depending on the communication purpose and needs. It represents our attitude; it reflects how we act at a particular moment.

**1. If we are selling or driving marketing efforts...** 

We tend to be bold and provocative. We want to have an impact on the listener and differentiate ourselves from competitors, that’s why our tone is often inquiring, stimulating and direct.

&nbsp;

**2. If we are creating Platform features...** 

We are explanatory and look for simplicity. We want users to understand things easily and have an enjoyable experience that doesn’t require effort from their side.

&nbsp;

**3. If we are providing support or delivery services...**

We are conversational and approachable. We want to have a fruitful relationship and foster natural and productive communication.

&nbsp;

**4. If we are talking about financial or legal situations...**

We are clear and formal. In these fields it’s crucial that the message is clear and no misunderstandings happen, that is why we are clear and tend to formality.
